# Mobile-App-development-notebooks
This repository is a collection of short and sweet guide to various app development related technologies like Flutter, Kotlin, Ionic, React native.

### Different type of mobile apps:

#### Native app 

It is the most widely used traditional way of making apps. Here you make different apps with different codebase to target different platforms.

General steps to make a native app.

Learn Java/Kotlin -> Download Android Studio -> Write code -> Build&Deploy

Learn Objective C/Swift -> Find a Mac for Xcode -> Write code -> Build&Deploy

#### Hybrid app

If you want to use web technologies then hybrid apps is the way to go.

General steps to make a hybrid app.

HTML, CSS, JS ->  Use Angular, React, Vue -> Use Ionic -> Build iOS and android apps

HTML, CSS, JS -> Use Cordova -> Build iOS and android apps

#### Compiled to Native

React Native and Flutter are good examples that help write code that gets converted to native to build iOS and android apps

#### PWAs

You must have come across a site that has a banner at the bottom asking you to ‘Add to home screen’. These are not real apps, but websites that behave like an installed app, also called Progressive Web Applications.

Like a typical website, PWAs are hosted on a server and distributed using URLs instead of app stores. A PWA is found by the users using search engines.

They utilize a technology called Service Workers which allow the website to work offline. Service Workers allow to cache the website on the device and provide an icon for the bookmark created on the device.

Google has provided a checklist which lists down the criterion for a website to be called a PWA. Native device features supported by modern web browsers like camera, audio recording, video capture is the limit for such apps.

<ul>
  <li>Choose Native if performance and access to device hardware features are important.</li>

  <li>Choose PWA if you are making an e-commerce website+app.</li>

  <li>Choose Compiled or Hybrid if you and your team are comfortable with web technologies and want to build apps in a limited time.</li>

  <li>Flutter looks very promising with easy styling, great performance, and Google’s backing.</li>

  <li>PWA has the highest reach with companies like Flipkart, Twitter Lite and Starbucks reporting increased user retention rate.</li>
</ul>
