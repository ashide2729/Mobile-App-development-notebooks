#### React Native:

It is a collection of special React components which gets compiled to Native Widgets.
In React native your define your View using React Native components instead of HTML components and define the business logic with JavaScript.
The View written in code gets compiled to Native code.
The JavaScript code with the help of JS core engine communicates with the native modules and API via a bridge.

#### To get started:

There are two CLIs available to develop and maintain React Native code;

#### Expo CLI:

Third party CLI free to use. Provides easy management because React Native can become complex when integrating native features.
Downside is you are limited to expo ecosystem. 

#### React native CLI:

Maintained by React Native team. Provides bare-bone development and integrating native features can be complex. Full flexibility.
We can always switch to other CLI.

Using Expo CLI:

Install Node.js
Run “npm install expo-cli -g” in command line

Creating project:

Go to your project folder
Run “expo init <project-name>” in command line and follow the instructions
cd to your created folder and run “npm start”
Once your project starts the webpage that opens provides you with easy code development and deployment environment.

Now you are all set to go, open your code in a code editor and start coding.

To run app on a device or emulator:
You can either use the CLI webpage tool or Install the Expo Client app on your device to scan the QR code and run the app on your phone.
